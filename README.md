**‚ùì Problem Statement**

According to a survey by the World Toilet Organization, 61% of people in 13 Asian countries avoid using public washrooms due to cleanliness concerns. In a survey by Initial Hygiene, 44% of people in Australia said they would not visit a business again if they encountered unclean washrooms. 

The lack of access to public restrooms is a common problem faced by many people, especially travelers, and tourists. Finding a clean and safe public restroom can be a challenging and time-consuming task, which can be further complicated by unfamiliarity with the location.
